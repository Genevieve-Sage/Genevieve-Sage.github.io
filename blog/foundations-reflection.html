      <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
          
          <ol>
            <li>
              I learned that if I get stuck on a problem that I need to find different ways to problem solve, rather than just stare at the problem 
              for hours on end, not moving forward.
            </li>
            <li>
              I find it very uncomfortable asking my peers for help, but it is ok to ask rather than just stew over something for hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have learned to put my ego aside and just get on with the task in hand.
            </li>
          </ol>


      <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
         <p>
           My values are the core beliefs I have that are important to me in the way I live and work. The value's of empathy and self-awareness are important
           because they allow you to build social connections with others. By understanding what people are thinking and feeling, we can all respond appropriately
           in any given situation. Having social connections is important for physical and psychological well-being. These values are important in learning and programming
           because you will always be interracting and working with, or alongside other people and understanding these factors can also reduce stress and build more 
           positive relationships.
         </p>

      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
         <p>
           While I have learned much of this core learning throughout my teaching career, I think it is always important to be reminded of it's importance. What has surprised me is that 
           reflecting on this really holds value, and you learn something new and deeper each time you reflect.
         </p>

      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
          <p>
           The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me has been to try not to spend hours researching and reading, as it is an area that I love very much.
          </p>

      <h4>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
          <p>
            Being a Programmer does not generally mean you will just work in isolation. What I mean by that is that you will be working with others. Often collaboratively, so you will need to be able to get along with others.
            As I said earlier understanding who you are will help you to understand others better. This will help build relationships, decrease work stress and just generally make your work life more fun and enjoyable.
          </p>

      <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
          <p>
            No, I think studying the core learning competencies is an essential skill for anyone/ everyone joining the workforce. Learning the core curriculum is definitely not a waste of time. I think practicing programming
            as much a possible is also important, but if you can't get along with others then it may be very difficult to get a job.
            Many people struggle with relationships and communication skills, and if you can improve these, then your worklife will be more rewarding and fun. The saying 'no man is an island' is an important 
            one to consider here, because on a daily basis we all interract with others and having more of an understanding about each other and what we bring to the table, helps us build more positive
            relationships and hence live happier and more fulfilled lives and who knows maybe even boost revenues.
