    <main>
      <p>Hi everyone, I’m Genevieve Sage, I like to be called Gen but just as happy with Genevieve. 
        <p>I got married in 2020 in among all the messiness of that year, and because of this I have changed my surname from Brown to Sage. It is not only a colour change, I also became ‘wise’, or I am trying to be!</p>
        <p>I live in Auckland Central, in an apartment on the 14th floor overlooking the port and the Auckland harbour. I love apartment living, at the moment anyway, because it is easy to lock up and leave. Although we can’t really go anywhere at this point. It’s a great place to get to all ammenities and get out along the waterfront for a run.</p>
        <p>In terms of values and identity, I have considered my core beliefs for several years and I consider love to be at the centre of my being.</p> 
        <p>Family was also very much at the top of that list, but as I lost both my parent’s in 2018 I had to reevaluate my idea of family and extend that out to the wider family and the importance of friendship.</p>
        <p>Having good work ethic, being reliable and self-awareness are also core values that I do try to uphold.</p>
        <p>I have made a point over the years to try to have a well-studied depth of self-awareness; this has led me to understanding and responding with resilience to the world around me, which I definitely have needed at points in my life. I developed this self-awareness as I have always been interested in the way I react to other people, how people react to me, how they react to different circumstances and why people behave the way they do. Through much examination, reflection, reading, counselling, watching clips and much study and introspection, I came across the Latin term, nosce te ipsum, know thyself, I became fascinated with understanding this principle. I wanted to know what this really meant so I researched and read widely on the subject for years. Because of this I became more aware of how my thoughts, feelings, and the words I verbalise can cause my circumstances to be either positive or negative, so I am mindful of these attributes.</p>
        <p>The reason I am attending Dev Academy actually all started several years ago. I was working for a not-for-profit and I was their administrator (this was a side hustle from my full-time role as a teacher). I had to make changes to the website and keep it updated. I decided to study the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> to help me and I found that I loved it. In 2020 a colleague introduced me to her son who had just graduated from EDA and I thought, wow, this is for me. It is a big change, but I know it is the right path for me and even though this sprint has been a challenge, I’m loving it. I look forward to meeting you all.</p>
    
      <h4>Describe your core personal values.</h4>
      <p>My core personal values or core beliefs are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Authenticity</li>
        <li>Kindness</li>
        <li>Knowledge</li>
        <li>Travel</li>
        <li>Justice</li>
        <li>Determination</li>
        <li>Leadership</li>
      </ul>
<p>This is just a few, but others, such as fairness, self-respect and trustworthiness are also very high on my list</p>
      
<h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>

      <p>After reading and researching about the mistreatment of chickens, I decided that I would only eat free range eggs.</p>
      <p>I wanted to be responsible about my egg consumption and for the welfare of animals. Free range eggs are defined by the conditions under which the chickens are kept. My decision was not for nutritional
        purposes. Taking this one step further, I do prefer 'certified organic' free range eggs.
      </p>
      <p>The main ethical concern in all egg laying systems is this: as only female chickens lay eggs, male chickens with no commercial value are killed shortly after
        birth. This is why I have made this decision to value other protein sources if I am unable to source free range chicken eggs.
      </p>
      <p>The value I demonstrate by choosing only free range eggs is that of love for all beings</p>
      <p>The consequences of choosing to only eat free range chicken eggs is that I feel better within myself because I am not supporting chicken mistreatment.
        I also feel healthier of mind and body as a result. And this leads to my feeling better about society as a whole.
      </p>

      
      <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>

      <p>My parent's, along with other fundamental influences during my upbringing, taught me about my identity and cultural values. From a very young age we travelled around the world. I grew up in Australia, living in the outback of the 
        Northern Territory, Perth, Darwin and Canberra. We also travelled extensively throughout New Zealand. I travelled through Malaysia, Hong Kong and to several Far East
        countries as a child. My role as an International Flight Attendant also took me to several places around the world and I spent some time living in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>All of these experiences have meant that my culture and identity involves a global perspective. My culture identifies with a love the mountains, the sea, different countries and the love of all people and the love of our differences.</p>
      <p>My culture has influenced my top values of love, authenticity, travel and kindness by making me a more well-rounded thinker. I like to see alternatives. I am not bound by looking at the world through one lens. That can have it's positives and negatives.
        The positives being that I can see all sides to an argument and the negatives being that same reason. 
      </p>

      <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h4>

      <p>I see the following as my strengths:</p>

        <p>I am very determined to succeed and even though I am just starting out in this career. I will make every effort to learn as fast as I can and as well as I can.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>I am determined</li>
         <li>I am persistent</li>
         <li>I am generally a positive person and I work well in groups most of the time</li>
         <li>I have a lot of life experience</li>
         <li>I take a measured approach to things</li>
         </ul>

        <p>My limitations:</p>
        <p>I do have a lot to learn in the area of web development. I am trying to learn fast, however this subject area is one where you can not just skip information, you need to know it all and this is very time consuming.
        I have a life outside of EDA and need to make sure I balance my studies with spending time with family and friends.
        I do not like to ask for help, but I am making myself vulnerable in this area.</p>


      <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h4>
<p>In terms of my learning and career development I can see that the strength of being persistent will mean that I am likely to continue on a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition. This strength, along with
  determination should lead to more positive outcomes in my learning and career development. Determination is all about firmness of purpose, so combined with persistence, success is more likely.
  My life experience is also a strength and can lead to my taking a measured, or well thought out approach to things. This means I am less likely to be reactive and more likely to be proactive.
  </p>
  <p>My limitations in terms of my learning and career development especially in this area mean that I am the learner at this stage, which is an area of vulnerability for me. To overcome this I will need to ask for help
    and not just have frantic moments of stress where I want to throw in the towel. I am good at life balance, this helps with my limitations because I have perspective. That is, I have the capacity to view things in their
    true relations of relative importance.
  </p>

</p>

      <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>

      <p>The strength that will help me with my learning journey is determination to succeed. Determination to succeed will intersect with learning obstacles because it will help me get through the tough times.
        It will give me the strength I need to overcome these obstacles because hand-in-hand with that determination is resilience, and my strong ability to cope with adversity.
        </p>

      <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>
      
  <p>I was trying to work productively on a group project with five other people. I was new to the material and at first lacked confidence, mainly because I thought the other group members
  had more experience in the area of the project. However, what I realised over time was that they were good at talking the talk, but not walking the talk and because of this resistence there was tension in the group dynamics.</p>

  <p>When I became aware of this issue, a strategy I used was to try to discuss my ideas with the group and have open communication. But their ego's got in the way, quite possibly for stereotypical reasons. I think they thought they knew more.
    But this strategy was not very effective because they would not listen and the project deadline was getting closer. I decided that I would just do all the research and work that I could do by myself. A second strategy that I used to get the group work on track was to share the research and work I had completed with the group.
    This strategy worked well and the other group members began to work more productively. We met the deadline and in the end we produced a reasonable project. This was a good outcome.
   </p>
<p>If I were to run into similar problems with group dynamics I would try to use some other motivational strategies to get the group working more cohesively.
  First, I would try the strategy of 'getting to know the group better', by meeting on a more social basis and just talking about everyday things so we can form common bonds.
  From here a second strategy I might try is generating some 'group rules' that we all establish together, and we sign them and make an oath to abide by these rules.

</p>
    <p>Using these strategies would hopefully ease tensions and make for a more collaborative and productive workflow.
