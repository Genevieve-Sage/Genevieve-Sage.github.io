    <h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
    <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
    <main>
        <p>
          The learning plan describes how I will operate in the context of the Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp programme. 
          I am fully committed to doing what I say I will do. If I say what, how and when I will do something, I will deliver it as promised. 
          If anything changes with that, I negotiate this in a timely and professional manner.
        </p>

    <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
  
        <p>
          My longterm goal is to become a senior web developer and perhaps start my own business. 
          I would like to start out working for a smaller organisation where I can have some solid mentoring for a few months. 
          Then I would like to develop more of my technical skills so that I can work at a higher level. 
          I will continue with my professional development, to stay relevant and up-to-date with the latest trends.
        </p>

    <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h4>

        <p>I see the following as my strengths:
           I am very determined to succeed and even though I am just starting out in this career I will make every effort to learn as fast as I can and as well as I can. 
           - I am persistent.
           - I am generally a positive person and I work well in groups most of the time.
           - I have a lot of experience at life.
           My limitations:
           I do have a lot to learn in this area. I am trying to learn fast, however this subject area is one where you can not just skip information, you need to know it all and this is very time consuming.
           I have a life outside of EDA and need to make sure I balance my studies with spending time with family and friends.
           I do not like to ask for help, but I am making myself vulnerable in this area.
        </p>

    <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
    </h4>
    
        <p>
          I am making a commitment to honour what I say I will do and complete tasks in a timely manner and well. If I don’t understand something I will research it and if I need further clarification I will ask my cohort or facilitators for help. 
          I have set myself a target to work Monday to Friday as a working week - 40 hours at least. If I have to work weekends I will, but I will make sure I have at least one day off per week.
          I will respect all the people I come into contact with and value their input. Having been a teacher and working with student’s I know that it is essential to consider the safety of the people around me. That means looking after peoples hearts and minds.
        </p>

    <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h4>
    
         <p>
           I will speak with someone and let them know if things are getting on top of me. 
           I will have some time out and get a bit of me time, i.e go to a movie, go shopping. 
           I enjoy exercising as I find it is a release for me and does relieve tension, so I will make sure I keep up with that. 
           I will try to come back with a fresh mind after having a short breather. 
         </p>

    <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>

         <p>
           I am committed to receiving help in a timely manner if things start to get on top of me.
         </p>

    <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>

         <p>
           I expect the facilitation team to be able to assist me if I am having difficulties within the learning environment. Sometimes things outside the classroom can also cause stress and I hope the facilitators will be understanding of these if they should arise.
           I would like them to also celebrate the wins and just generally be a positive and encouraging bunch.
         </p>

     <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
         For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
     </h4>

         <p>
           If I have any appointments, I will ensure I tell the school especially when I am on bootcamp and ensure I do so in a timely manner. 
           Otherwise, I am really enjoying the challenge and I am all in.
         </p>

     <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>

     <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

         <p>
           I am hoping to use these skills I gain during the course to move into a technology based career. I would like to start out in web design.
           I would like to have an impact with my creativity within the software development arena, that is to build beautifully grafted, easy to use websites or
           learning pathways for students. Perhaps I will use my talents to upgrade the New Zealand Curriculum in some way. My destination is still in it's formation stage.
         </p>



     <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>

         <p>
           My greatest strengths in Bootcamp will be my resilience and drive, I like completion. I think my limitations will likely be how quickly I pick up 
           the knowledge.
         </p>


     <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>

         <p>
           I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be having to spend the first few weeks of Bootcamp working from home instead of in the classroom with people.
           I enjoy being around people and it is also easier to bounce ideas off each other if you are in the same room.
         </p>


     <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>

         <p>
           It is always beneficial to continue to hone your communication skills. Anything to do with improved listening and communication would be awesome.
         </p>


     <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>

         <p>
           I expect the Bootcamp team to be available, to be friendly and knowledgeable. That they will freely share their knowledge and not be too judgemental when something takes a while to click.
         </p>


     <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>

         <p>
           While on Bootcamp I expect myself to show up ready and willing to get on with the day's tasks to the best of my ability. I will be reliable and also let others know when I am finding problem solving a challenge.
           I will put my best foot forward and be kind and considerate at all times. I will study as much as I can so that I can offer as much as possible to my peers.
         </p>
