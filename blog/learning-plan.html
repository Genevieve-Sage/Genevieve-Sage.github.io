    <h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
    <h4>Read this Blog to find out!</h4>
    <main>
    <p>The learning plan describes how I will operate in the context of the Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp programme. 

      I am fully committed to doing what I say I will do. If I say what, how and when I will do something, I will deliver it as promised. 
      If anything changes with that, I negotiate this in a timely and professional manner.</p>

      <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h4>
  
    <p>My longterm goal is to become a senior web developer and perhaps start my own business. 
      I would like to start out working for a smaller organisation where I can have some solid mentoring for a few months. 
      Then I would like to develop more of my technical skills so that I can work at a higher level. 
      I will continue with my professional development, to stay relevant and up-to-date with the latest trends.
    </p>

    <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h4>

    <p>I see the following as my strengths:
I am very determined to succeed and even though I am just starting out in this career I will make every effort to learn as fast as I can and as well as I can. 
- I am persistent.
- I am generally a positive person and I work well in groups most of the time.
- I have a lot of experience at life.
My limitations:
I do have a lot to learn in this area. I am trying to learn fast, however this subject area is one where you can not just skip information, you need to know it all and this is very time consuming.
I have a life outside of EDA and need to make sure I balance my studies with spending time with family and friends.
I do not like to ask for help, but I am making myself vulnerable in this area.</p>

<h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
  </h4>
    
  <p>I am making a commitment to honour what I say I will do and complete tasks in a timely manner and well. If I don’t understand something I will research it and if I need further clarification I will ask my cohort or facilitators for help. 

    I have set myself a target to work Monday to Friday as a working week - 40 hours at least. If I have to work weekends I will, but I will make sure I have at least one day off per week.
    
    I will respect all the people I come into contact with and value their input. Having been a teacher and working with student’s I know that it is essential to consider the safety of the people around me. That means looking after peoples hearts and minds.
    </p>

    <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    </h4>
    
    <p>I will speak with someone and let them know if things are getting on top of me. 
      I will have some time out and get a bit of me time, i.e go to a movie, go shopping. 
      I enjoy exercising as I find it is a release for me and does relieve tension, so I will make sure I keep up with that. 
      I will try to come back with a fresh mind after having a short breather. 
    </p>

    <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h4>

    <p>I am committed to receiving help in a timely manner if things start to get on top of me.
    </p>

    <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
    </h4>

    <p>I expect the facilitation team to be able to assist me if I am having difficulties within the learning environment. Sometimes things outside the classroom can also cause stress and I hope the facilitators will be understanding of these if they should arise.

      I would like them to also celebrate the wins and just generally be a positive and encouraging bunch.
      </p>

      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
        For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
      </h4>

      <p>If I have any appointments, I will ensure I tell the school especially when I am on bootcamp and ensure I do so in a timely manner. 
        Otherwise, I am really enjoying the challenge and I am all in.
