          <h4 class="aligncenter">Research on Neuroplasticity</h4>




          <h4 class="aligncenter">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h4>

          <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to adapt. Or put another way, it refers to the physiological changes in the brain that happen as the result of our interactions with our environment.
          </p>

          <p>Our brains are like computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.
          </p>

          <p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurone. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but is also something that we can encourage and stimulate.
          </p>

          <p>The term “neuroplasticity” was first used by Polish neuroscientist Jerry Kornorski in 1948 to describe observed changes in neuronal structure.
          </p>

          <p>There are two main types of neuroplasticity:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Structural neuroplasticity, in which the strength of the connections between neurone (or synapses) changes.
              </li>
              <li>Functional neuroplasticity, which describes the permanent changes in synapses due to learning and development.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <p>Structural neuroplasticity is the type that is more attended to at the moment. Functions can be rerouted, relearned, and reestablished in the brain, but changes to the actual structure of the brain are where many of the exciting possibilities lie.</p>

          <p>Understanding neuroplasticity is incredibly important because it is at the root of essential human experiences. Learning and memory, key parts to what it means to be human, would not be possible without this process.
            Remodelling this circuitry with each new experience - our brain makes us who we are, enabling us to perceive beauty, teach our children, remember loved ones, react against injustice, learn from history, and imagine a different future.
            </p>

            <p>Neoroplasticity is a factor in recovering from brain injury. Part of the rehabilitation process is aimed at trying to rebuild connections among the nerve cells - or neurons. This “re-wiring” of the brain can make it possible for a function previously managed by a damaged area to be taken over by another undamaged area. In addition, there is more information to be discovered about actual neurogenesis, that is, generation of new brain cells.
            </p>



          <h4 class="aligncenter">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h4>

          <p>The relation between neuroplasticity and learning is an easy one to surmise - when we learn, we form new pathways in the brain. Each new lesson has the potential to connect new neurons and change our brains default mode of operation.
          </p>

          <p>Not all learning is created equal - learning new facts does not take advantage of the amazing neuroplasticity of the brain, but learning a new language or a musical instrument certainly does. </p>

          <p>Having more understanding of neuroplasticity means that you can and actually do change or rewire your brain if you invest in learning new ideas and concepts. Engaging with these principles can be of benefit because by understanding that the brain is actually a dynamically changing organ then you also understand that behavioural and thought patterns can be changed and new neural pathways developed. It is possible to learn throughout life.
          </p>




          <h4 class="aligncenter">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
          </h4>

          <p>To increase neuroplasticity you can begin by selecting an activity that is new to you, such as web development. Commit yourself to engaging in the exercise as frequently as you can. You will also further your neuroplastic change if you eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly and connect with others.

          <h4 class="aligncenter">Research on Growth Mindset</h4>


          <h4 class="aligncenter">Discuss what it is and why is it relevant
          </h4>

          <p>Many people tend to give up when they encounter failure and hardship in studies because they believe that it means they are simply not good at the subject, or that they lack the level of intelligence necessary to excel at the subject. This is what is referred to as a fixed mindset. However, students can also have what is referred to as a growth mindset, which states that the brain is capable of overcoming the challenges it faces in new areas of learning. It is possible to develop a growth mindset, and doing so can help a person overcome the hurdles they face in learning and develop the necessary skills to persist.
          </p>

          <p>American psychologist, Carol Dweck explains that there are two categories of mindsets, a growth mindset vs. a fixed mindset.

            People who have a “fixed mindset” believe that intelligence and other abilities are “fixed” and cannot change. People who have “growth mindsets” believe that intelligence and abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication. Having a “growth mindset” means you understand that you can improve or learn more, as long as you put in the effort</p>

          <p>In short, understanding that you can have a growth mindset empowers people to believe they can develop their abilities. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that are essential for accomplishment in just about any sphere.
            </p>
          


          <h4 class="aligncenter">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>

          <p>In this exploration what surprised me was the amount of information there is out there on growth mindset. As a teacher I had studied growth mindset several years ago and have implemented these strategies into my teaching. I have always held the belief that my student’s can succeed with study, understanding, resilience and sometimes making themselves vulnerable to failure.
          </p>

          <p>What changed for me was that I was reminded of the importance to persevere when the going gets tough and that being in the position of the learner is a challenge, but I want this so I will be persistent in my efforts to succeed because I have a growth mindset.
          </p>




          <h4 class="aligncenter">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
          </h4>

          <p>I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey by reminding myself that I am able to learn new tasks, strategies, languages etc, through the process of neuroplasticity and growth mindset. I will be persistent and resilient and overcome the challenges that I face because I know that eventually through persistent action I will succeed in my new learning.

          </h4>


          <h4 class="aligncenter">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategies.
          </h4>

          <p>In considering what I have learned in this exploration on neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I have been reminded of the habits of mind of persistence and perseverance. In order to learn something new and challenging I will remember to  push through when I hear that internal voice being negative. I will turn that around and say “I am a capable woman, and I can do this”.</p>

          <p>Learning this has let me see that I can transform my learning plan and strategies so that I have more time practicing the material and researching. Just getting on with the task in hand in the knowledge that wth persistence I can and will learn web development.</p>
