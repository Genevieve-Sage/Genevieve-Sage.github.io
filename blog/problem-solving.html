      <h4>What happened when I got blocked on a simple problem?</h4>
        <p>Not every problem is easy to solve and learning web development brings with it a plethora of problems to be solved.
        </p>

        <p>I was working through some JavaScript programming problems and came across a curly problem. How to capitalise the first letter of each word in JavaScript. Of course there is no one universal solution to solve a problem but I will try to show you one simple way to solve this problem.
        </p>

        <p>JavaScripts toUpperCase() method converts a string object into a new string consisting of the contents of the first string, with all alphabetic characters converted to be upper case (i.e. capitalised).
        </p>

        <p>With the use of a few problem solving techniques I managed to work my way through the process of capitalising the first letter of each word in a particular string. The following explains some of the problem solving techniques I used and how they helped me.
        </p>

        <p>When I got stuck I first tried to work out the problem logically by just trying some code that I knew was close to what I thought the answer would be. I tried a few different ways of writing the code. When I had exhausted all avenues with this technique I decided to try googling the answer. This led me to several interesting websites on how to capitalise the first letter of multiple strings. This was helpful and I was able to get a substantial way through answering the test question. However, there was some pretty technical language and the depth was a little more than I needed. I needed to bring the problem back to more simple terms.
        </p>

        <p>I tried writing pseudocode, that is, writing a plain language description of the steps in the algorithm. I seemed to be able to do this ok. I also followed the error messages with my pseudocode and this did help me to move forward with baby steps. I tried console.logging but I have not quite got the hang of that and do need to research it a bit more to feel comfortable. However, when I realised I needed a little more help I put the question out to my peers and asked for a hint. I also asked my coach. Fortunately I was able to find the correct answer and test it and, yahoo, a small win to celebrate!
