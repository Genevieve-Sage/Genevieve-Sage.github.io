      <h4>What happened when I got blocked on a simple problem?</h4>
        <p>Not every problem is easy to solve and learning web development brings with it a plethora of problems to be solved.
        </p>

        <p>I was working through some JavaScript programming problems and came across a curly problem. How to capitalise the first letter of each word in JavaScript. Of course there is no one universal solution to solve a problem but I will try to show you one simple way to solve this problem.
        </p>

        <p>JavaScripts toUpperCase() method converts a string object into a new string consisting of the contents of the first string, with all alphabetic characters converted to be upper case (i.e. capitalised).
        </p>

        <p>With the use of a few problem solving techniques I managed to work my way through the process of capitalising the first letter os each word in a particular string. The following explains some of the problem solving techniques I used and how they helped me.
